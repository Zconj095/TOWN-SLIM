Lily Thornfield was born into a family of traveling performers, where artistry and music were woven into everyday life. Her parents, though loving and supportive, struggled with stability and organization, reflecting Lily's own tendencies to be disorganized and forgetful. This upbringing instilled in her a passion for creativity, but also taught her to adapt to chaotic situations.

As she grew older, Lily became increasingly moody, struggling to balance her emotions amidst the constant changes of their nomadic lifestyle. She found solace in sketching and painting, losing herself in the world of colors and shapes. Her art became an outlet for her feelings, a means to express the turmoil brewing beneath her gentle exterior.

Lily's family eventually settled in a small village on the outskirts of a kingdom, where she continued to hone her artistic skills. However, her disorganization often led to missed appointments and forgotten responsibilities, causing friction with the villagers who relied on her for services such as murals and tapestries.
