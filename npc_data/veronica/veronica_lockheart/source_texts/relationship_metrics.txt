### **How Veronica Lockheart Makes Enemies:**

1. **Ruthless Criticism of the Undisciplined:**
   Veronica has little patience for laziness, lack of effort, or disorganization. When she encounters people who are undisciplined, she doesn’t hesitate to deliver sharp, cutting remarks.

2. **Impatience with Incompetence:**
   Veronica's high standards extend to her collaborators and peers. When she works with others, she expects competence and professionalism.
