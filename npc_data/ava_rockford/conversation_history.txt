Summary: The Player and Ava Rockford engaged in a terse and unpleasant exchange within Ava’s cafe. The Player initially attempted pleasantries, requesting tea and scones, but Ava responded with curtness and a clear indication she prioritized efficiency over customer service. The Player then shared observations about the post-cataclysm world – dragons and the haunting of Chicago – emphasizing the importance of external reality anchors while trapped in cyclical memories. Seeking information about an orc named Gorrak Ironhide, the Player offered payment, initially met with a demand for a gold coin before settling on five. After receiving directions to the Stag’s Head Inn, the Player warned Ava that they would reclaim the coins if the information proved false. Throughout the interaction, Ava consistently rebuffed the Player’s attempts at conversation, deeming them presumptuous and disrespectful. The Player abruptly left in protest of Ava's rudeness. Unexpectedly, the Player returned moments later, departing dramatically atop a dragon, a spectacle that left Ava utterly speechless. Following the Player’s flamboyant exit, Ava expressed her frustration and desire for the Player to seek service elsewhere.
