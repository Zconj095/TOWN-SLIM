The Player and Ava Rockford engaged in a lengthy conversation during which the Player ordered tea and scones. The Player shared observations about the post-cataclysm world, specifically mentioning the return of dragons and the haunting of Chicago, detailing how the city traps people in repetitive loops based on past memories and ley line magic. The Player emphasized the importance of having an outside connection to reality while caught in such situations. They revealed they no longer have such a connection and requested another scone, praising its quality. The Player then inquired about unusual occurrences around town, leading to a discussion of an orc named Gorrak. The Player sought information on Gorrak Ironhide, and Ava Rockford initially demanded a single gold coin for the information, ultimately settling on five gold coins. The Player stated their intention to enlist Gorrak’s aid, a detail Ava probed further.  The Player received directions to the Stag’s Head Inn where Gorrak can be found, and handed over the agreed-upon payment.  The Player concluded by warning Ava that they would return for the coins if the information proved false, placing the burden of accuracy on Ava.
